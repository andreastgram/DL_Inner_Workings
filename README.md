# DL_Inner_Workings
A repository taking a deeper dive into deep learning concepts and building blocks. Used for reference and practice. Implemented with PyTorch

* Convolutions and how they enable convolutional neural networks that have dominated image-based deep learning.

* Recurrent neural networks, encoding sequential information, and how they can be used for text classification problems.

* Newer training techniques that can be applied to any neural network to obtain higher accuracy in less time, and explains how they can achieve this goal.

* Modern design patterns in common use today.

* Autoencoding as a technique for training a neural network without labeled data, allowing unsupervised learning.

* Image segmentation and object detection as two techniques you can use to find multiple items within an image.

* Generative adversarial network, an unsupervised approach that can produce synthetic data and is the foundation of many modern image-alteration and deep-fake techniques.
